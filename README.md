# surface_water_mapping_sentinel2_gee
This project uses a Random Forest classifier on Sentinel-2 imagery in Google Earth Engine for surface water maping. Spectral bands, NDVI and MNDWI and user-defined training samples achieved 100% accuracy. Outputs include AOI-clipped water maps and true-color imagery for GIS and hydrological analysis.
